### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite because I was able to implement some of my knowledge of Blackjack into coding. I was also able to learn how to actually code Blackjack. 

* Lab 3

    For Lab 3, I enjoyed part 2 because it was very interesting to learn what a Julian Day was. It was also very interesting to learn how to code the difference between two dates. 

* Lab 5
    For Lab 5, it was interesting to see how to convert units of measurement into coding. I was able to understand how static_cast works and what it could be used for.
